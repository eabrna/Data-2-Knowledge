# [Exercises]{style="color:#FF7F50"}

We have officially ended our coverage of tree models. Let’s cap it off with a Kaggle contest.

## [Practice: house prices prediction using tree models]{style="color:#FF7F50"}

You are to make at least one official entry in the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) Kaggle contest.

* Step 1: You will need to register in Kaggle (it's free). Once you have created your Kaggle account, please team up with no more than two of your classmates for this contest [teaming](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/team).

* Step 2: Read the details of the contest. Understand the data and evaluation function.

* Step 3: Make at least one submission. If you get a score on the public leaderboard of RMSE<0.20 (note RMSE is calculated on the log scale), you receive full credit; otherwise, you’ll lose 20 points.

* Step 4: Complete this practice sheet and submit it to Canvas. Each group should submit only one completed sheet. Please ensure that the names of all group members are listed on this practice sheet.

Tip: Check out the [Kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) which let you make submissions directly from the notebook. It's very similar to using Google Colab in which you can make a RMarkdown/Jupyter notebook or R/Python scrips that run on the cloud. Free CPU (4 cores, 16GB RAM) - amazing! Let your laptops cool off after all their hard work this semester.

**Top 6 scores from all groups across section 002 & 003 will get certificates!**

### Competition submission

#### {.solution}

1. Your Kaggle names and team name.

* Kaggle name(s): Elliot Brna; ; Meng Xu.

* Kaggle team name (leave NA if you work alone): XXX

2. Your RMSE score and current ranking on the Kaggle leaderboard

* RMSE score: ???

* Current ranking on the Kaggle leaderboard: ???

3. Finally, attach your code for this competition below.
