### 1. Correlation in StatGrades.
Part 1: What is the correlation between exam1 and exam2?

Part 2: What is the correlation between exam2 and exam1?

Part 3: Is the linear correlation coefficient between exam1 and exam2 the same as the linear correlation coefficient between exam2 and exam1? Why?

Part 4: Plot exam2 (on y axis) vs exam1 (on x axis) and include the linear regression line, then plot exam1 vs exam2 and include the linear regression line, display such two plots in one column using par(mfcol=c(2,1)).

Part 5: Find the intercepts, slopes, and r2 of the two regression lines. Are they the same? Why?


#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...
attach(StatGrades)

#Part 1
c1 = cor(StatGrades$exam1, StatGrades$exam2)
print(paste('The correlation between exam1 and exam2 is', c1))

#Part 2
c2 = cor(StatGrades$exam2, StatGrades$exam1)
print(paste('The correlation between exam1 and exam2 is', c2))

#Part 4
fit1 <- lm(StatGrades$exam2 ~ StatGrades$exam1)
fit2 <- lm(StatGrades$exam1 ~ StatGrades$exam2)

par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(StatGrades$exam1, StatGrades$exam2, main= "Exam1 vs Exam2", xlab = 'Exam1', ylab = 'Exam2', ylim = c(0,100))
abline(fit1, col = 'red')
plot(StatGrades$exam2, StatGrades$exam1, main = "Exam2 vs Exam1", xlab = 'Exam2', ylab = 'Exam1', ylim = c(0,100))
abline(fit2, col = 'red')

#Part 5
slope1 = coef(fit1)[2]
intercept1 = coef(fit1)[1]
r21 = summary(fit1)$r.squared

slope2 = coef(fit2)[2]
intercept2 = coef(fit2)[1]
r22 = summary(fit2)$r.squared
```

Part 3: The linear correlation coefficients for both Part 1 and 2 are the same due to the fact that the correlation coefficient is not dependent on the order of the variables.

Part 5: The r^2 values for both fits are the same, which can be understood by the fact that their linear correlation coefficients are the same.The slope and intercept values are different given the nature in which exam1 and exam2 are plotted in eah graph.

### 2. Major league baseball attendance. Problem 11.2 from URIS.
For the data set MLBattend (UsingR) concerning Major League Baseball attendance, fit a linear model of attendance modeled by wins. What is the predicted increase in attendance if a team that won 80 games last year wins 90 this year?

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...
attendance_by_wins = lm(attendance ~ wins, data = MLBattend)
predictions = predict(attendance_by_wins, data.frame(wins = c(80, 90)))
increase = (predictions[2]-predictions[1])/predictions[1]

print(paste("There will be a ", increase*100, "% increase in attendance"))

```

### 3. Influence of parent's heigh on child's height. Problem 11.4 from URIS.
The galton (UsingR) data set contains data collected by Francis Galton in 1885 concerning the influence a parent’s height has on a child’s height. 

Fit a linear model for a child’s height modeled by his parent’s height. 

Make a scatterplot with a regression line.

What is the value of Beta 1 (slope of best fit line) , and why is this of interest?

*Plot a Q-Q graph for each column in the dataset using qqnorm().


#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...
fit <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
plot(galton$child ~ galton$parent, xlab = 'Parent Height', ylab = 'Child Height')
abline(fit, col = 'red')
beta1 = coef(fit)[2]
print(paste('Beta 1 =', beta1))

## Q-Q plots
par(mfcol = c(1,2))

qqnorm(galton$child, main="Q-Q plot & line for child's height")
qqline(galton$child, col="blue")

qqnorm(galton$parent, main="Q-Q plot & line for parent's height")
qqline(galton$parent, col="blue")
```

Beta 1 is the slope of the best fit line which tells us that for every 1 inch that the parent's height increases, the child's height will increase by 0.646 inches based on the linear regression model.


### 4. Heart-rate model. Problem 11.16 in URIS.
Find and plot both the prediction and the confidence intervals for the heart-rate model: 
  res.mhr <- lm(maxrate ~ age, data=heartrate).


#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...
res.mhr <- lm(maxrate ~ age, data=heartrate)  # linear model for using age to predict heart rate
age_sorted = sort(unique(heartrate$age));     # sorts the ages and removes repeated ages

conf_interval = predict(res.mhr, data.frame(age = age_sorted), interval="confidence");    # confidence interval for each of the ages
predict_interval = predict(res.mhr, data.frame(age = age_sorted), interval="prediction");   # prediction interval for each of the ages

# plots the original data and the linear regression line
plot(maxrate ~ age, data=heartrate)
abline(res.mhr)

# plots the prediction and confidence intervals
matlines(age_sorted, predict_interval[,2:3], lty = 2, col = 6)
matlines(age_sorted, conf_interval[,2:3], lty = 2, col = 4)

```
Write your conclusion here...
Confidence intervals are in green and prediction intervals are in red. As expected the prediction intervals are all wider than the confidence intervals.

### 5. Oxides of nitrogen. Problem 12.19 from DEVORE.
Data is representative of that reported in the
article “An Experimental Correlation of Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions from Power Boilers Based on Field Data” where x = burner area liberation rate (MBtu/hr-ft2) and y = NOx emission rate (ppm).

a. Assuming that the simple linear regression model is valid, obtain the least squares estimate of the true regression line.

b. What is the estimate of expected NOx emission rate when burner area liberation rate equals 225?

c. Estimate the amount by which you expect NOx emission rate to change when burner area liberation rate is decreased by 50 (175).

d. Would you use the estimated regression line to predict emission rate for a liberation rate of 500? Why or why not?



#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...
liberation_rate = c(100, 125, 125, 150, 150, 200, 200, 250, 250, 300, 300, 350, 400, 400)
NOx_emissions = c(150, 140, 180, 210, 190, 320, 280, 400, 430, 440, 390, 600, 610, 670)

#a
fit <- lm(NOx_emissions ~ liberation_rate)
fit$coefficients

#b
predictionb = predict(fit, data.frame(liberation_rate = c(225)))

print(paste('The estimation of the NOx emission rate when the liberation rate equals 225 MBtu/hr-ft2 is',predictionb, 'ppm.' ))

#c
predictionc = predict(fit, data.frame(liberation_rate = c(175)))

final_prediction = predictionb-predictionc
print(paste('As the liberation rate decreases by 50 MBtu/hr-ft2, we expect NOx emissions to decrease by', final_prediction, 'ppm.'))
```

# Part D:
- No, a liberation rate of 500 is outside the range of the data that the line is fit to (extrapolation). It is unknown how well the line represents the data outside of the burner area liberation rates of 100 to 400 and therefor should not be used to estimate values outside the range 

### 6. Traffic flow. Problem 12.49 from DEVORE.
You are told that a 95% CI for expected lead content when traffic flow is 15, based on a sample of n = 10 observations, is (462.1, 597.7). Calculate a CI with confidence level 99% for expected lead content when traffic flow is 15.


#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...

# critical t-value for 95% confidence interval with a sample size of 10 
t_95 = qt( .95, df = 9 )

# distance between points = 2*SE*t
t_x_SE = (597.7-462.1)/2
SE = t_x_SE/t_95

# mean is the middle point between the bounds
mean = (597.7+462.1)/2

# critical t-value for a 99% confidence interval
t_99 = qt( .99, df = 9 )

#bounds = mean +/- t-score*SE
upper = mean + t_99*SE
lower = mean - t_99*SE

print( paste("99% Confidence Interval: (", lower, ",", upper, ")"))


```

### 7. Plasma etching. Problem 12.52 from DEVORE.
Plasma etching is essential to the fine-line pattern transfer in current semiconductor processes. The article “Ion Beam-Assisted Etching of Aluminum with Chlorine” (J. of the
Electrochem. Soc., 1985: 2010– 2012) gives the accompanying data (read from a graph) on chlorine flow (x, in SCCM) through a nozzle used in the etching mechanism and etch rate (y, in 100 A/min).

The summary statistics are listed with the problem in the textbook. 

a. Does the simple linear regression model specify a useful relationship between chlorine flow and etch rate?

b. Estimate the true average change in etch rate associated with a 1-SCCM increase in flow rate using a 95% confidence interval, and interpret the interval.
**page 494/5 (515 of pdf) has the formula + an example - true average change refers to the slope regression

c. Calculate a 95% CI for muY, 3.0, the true average etch rate when flow = 3.0. Has this average been precisely estimated?
**page 501 (522 in pdf)

d. Calculate a 95% PI for a single future observation on etch rate to be made when flow = 3.0 . Is the prediction likely to be accurate?
** page 504 (525 in pdf)

e. Would the 95% CI and PI when flow = 2.5 be wider or narrower than the corresponding intervals of parts (c) and (d)? Answer without actually computing the intervals.

f. Would you recommend calculating a 95% PI for a flow of 6.0? Explain.


#### {.solution}
```{r}

chlorine_flow <- c(1.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 4.0)
etch_rate <- c(23.0, 24.5, 25.0, 30.0, 33.5, 40.0, 40.5, 47.0, 49.0)

# Summary statistics
sum_xi = 24.0
sum_yi = 312.5
sum_xi_sqd = 70.50
sum_xiyi = 902.25
sum_yi_sqd = 11626.75
B_0 = 6.448718        # intercept
B_1 = 10.602564       # slope

mean = mean(chlorine_flow)

#a
fit <- lm(etch_rate ~ chlorine_flow)
summary(fit)$r.squared

#b
s = sqrt(sum(residuals(fit)^2) / (9-2))
sb1 = s/sqrt(sum_xi_sqd)
# t value at 95% Confidence interval and n = 7 (9-2 = 7 DOF) = 2.365
lower = B_1 - 2.365*(sb1)
upper = B_1 + 2.365*(sb1)

print(paste('The 95% confidence interval of the data is [', lower, ',', upper, '].'))

#c
muy = 3.0

y_hat = B_0 + B_1*(muy)
sy_hat = s * sqrt((1/9) + ((muy - mean)^2)/sum_xi_sqd)

lower1 = B_1 - 2.365*(sy_hat)
upper1 = B_1 + 2.365*(sy_hat)

print(paste('The 95% confidence interval of the data is [', lower1, ',', upper1, '].'))

#d
lower2 = y_hat - 2.365 * sqrt(s^2 + sy_hat^2)
upper2 = y_hat + 2.365 * sqrt(s^2 + sy_hat^2)

print(paste('The 95% PI for a single future observation on etch rate is [', lower2, ',', upper2, '].'))
```
Part a: Based on the high r^2 value of the liner regression model, this value is a very good indication that the linear model is a useful relationship between chlorine flow and etch rate.
Part c: Yes, this average has been precisely estimated due to the large percentage of confidence (95%).
Part d: 
Part e: Based on the formula, the both the CI and PI would be expected to be narrower than that of 3.0, since 2.5 is closer to the actual mean of chlorine flow.
Part f: No, this flow is outside the range of data given and therefore would require extrapolation which is best avoided.
