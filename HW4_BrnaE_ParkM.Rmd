# [Problems]{style="color:#FF7F50"}

This homework problem set covers correlation & smoothing spline, which will be tested in your exam 1. Part I problems will use `fat` dataset, and Part II problems will use `Animals` dataset. Both are in Verzani's textbook package `UsingR`. **In the problems below, any plot of Y vs X will have the vertical axis as Y-axis and horizontal axis as X-axis.**
```{r message=FALSE}

```

## Part I

### Problem 1

(i) Plot `neck` vs `wrist` for individuals of age larger than 20 and less than 30;

(ii) Plot `neck` vs `wrist` for individuals of age larger than 50;

(iii) Plot `neck` vs `height` for individuals of age larger than 20 and less than 30; 

(iv) Plot `neck` vs `height` for individuals of age larger than 50.

#### {.solution}

```{r}
attach(fat)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

fat_subset1 <- subset(fat, age > 20 & age < 30)
fat_subset2 <- subset(fat, age > 50)

# i

# ii
plot(fat_subset2$wrist, fat_subset2$neck, xlab = "Wrist", ylab = "Neck", main = "Neck vs Wrist (Age > 50)")

# iii
plot(fat_subset1$height, fat_subset1$neck, xlab = "Height", ylab = "Neck", main = "Neck vs Height (Age 20-30)")

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your code here.
animals = row.names(Animals) #collects names of animals for graphing

cross_prod <- (body-mean(body))*(brain-mean(brain))

```

### Problem 2 (2)

List Animals with a negative cross product (only first 6).

#### {.solution}

barplot(as.vector(as.matrix(positive_crossprod[3])), names.arg = row.names(positive_crossprod),main = "Positive Cross Products", las=2, cex.names = .7)

```

### Problem 3 (1)

Rank the variable `body` and name the rank vector as `rbody`.

#### {.solution}

lines(spline.fit,lwd=2, col="blue")
```
### Problem 5 (1)

Let's do log transformation of data (see Page 120 Verzani).
```{r}
lbody <- log(body)
lbrain <- log(brain)
```

Do a bar plot of the cross product of `lbody` and `lbrain`.

#### {.solution}
```{r}

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your code here.

#linear regression
lline <- lm(lbrain~lbody)
abline(lline, col = 'red')

# smoothing splide
lspline.fit <- smooth.spline(lbrain~lbody, df=5)
lines(lspline.fit,lwd=2, col="blue")

```

### Problem 5 (3)

Find all the correlation coefficients for `lbrain` and `lbody`.

print(paste("Pearson correlation coefficient:", format(lcor.rank_pearson, digits = 4)))

lcor.rank_kendall = cor(lbody, lbrain, method = "kendall")
print(paste("Kendall correlation coefficient:", format(lcor.rank_kendall, digits = 4)))

lcor.rank_spearman = cor(lbody, lbrain, method = "spearman")
print(paste("Spearman correlation coefficient:", format(lcor.rank_spearman, digits = 4)))

```

### Problem 6 (1)

Lastly, we run correlation tests: for `brain` and `body`, run the correlation test and print the p-value.

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your code here.
pearson.p_value = cor.test(brain, body, alternative="greater", method="pearson")$p.value
print(paste("Pearson p-value for brain and body", pearson.p_value))

```

### Problem 6 (2)

For `rbrain` and `rbody`, run the correlation test and print the p-value.

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your code here.
rpearson.p_value = cor.test(rbrain, rbody, alternative="greater", method="pearson")$p.value
print(paste("Pearson p-value for rbrain and rbody", rpearson.p_value))


```

### Problem 6 (3)

For `lbrain` and `lbody`, run the correlation test and print the p-value.

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your code here.
lpearson.p_value = cor.test(lbrain, lbody, alternative="greater", method="pearson")$p.value
print(paste("Pearson p-value for brain and body", lpearson.p_value))

```

### Problem 6 (4)

Explain why the second and the third correlation coefficients are equal to the corresponding ones in `rbody`-`rbrain` and `lbody-lbrain`.
body - brain correlation coefficients
[1] "Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.7163"
#[1] "Kendall correlation coefficient: 0.6172"
#[1] "Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.7163"

rbody - rbrain correlation coefficients
[1] "Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.7163"
#[1] "Kendall correlation coefficient: 0.6172"
#[1] "Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.7163"

lbody-lbrain correlation coefficients
[1] "Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.7795"
#[1] "Kendall correlation coefficient: 0.6172"
#[1] "Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.7163"



#### {.solution}
Your answer: The Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients match throughout each data set because they look for a non-linear correlations between variables based on rank. Taking the rank of body/brain or log of body/brain doesn't change each animal's rank relative to each other giving the same Kendall and Spearman coefficients.
