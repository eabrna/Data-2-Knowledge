## [Problems]{style="color:#FF7F50"}

We need to first load Verzani's textbook packages `MASS`, `UsingR`, our course package `APMA3150` in our working environment. 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(UsingR)
library(APMA3150)
```

### 1. Negation operator. Problem 2.15 from URIS.
The negation operator ! is used to reverse Boolean values. For example:
```{r}
A <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
!A
```
One of De Morgan's laws in R code is !(A & B) = !A | !B. Verify this with B  <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUEE) and A as above.
# !(A&B) indicates that both A and B are not true
# !A|!B indicates that either A is false or B is false (or both)
```{r}
A <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
B <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
!(A&B)
!A|!B
!(A&B) == (!A|!B)
```
Written out:

A <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
B <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
A & B <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

!(A & B) <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) 

!A <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
!B <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

!A | !B <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

Therefore, !(A & B) = !A | !B = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

### 2. CD sales. Problem 2.20 from URIS.
Suppose monthly sales (in 10,000s) of CDs in 2013 were

JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC
79  74  161 127 133 210 99  143 249 249 368 302

Enter the data into a data vector cd. Through indexing, form two data vectors: one containing the months with 31 days, the other the remaining months. Compare the means of these two data vectors.
```{r}
# Months with 30 days: Apr (4), Jun(6), Sep(9), Nov(11)
cd = c(79, 74, 161, 127, 133, 210, 99, 143, 249, 249, 368, 302)
thirty_days = cd[c(4,6,9,11)]         # CD sales for months with 30 days
other_months = cd[c(-4,-6,-9,-11)]    # CD sales for months without 30 days

mean(thirty_days)
mean(other_months)
```
The months with 30 days have higher CD sales on average.

### 3. Prime numbers. Complete problem 2.25 from URIS.
*Name your function isprime(), then call this function with 4 and 37 as arguments to test the correctness

Write a function isprime() that checks if a number x is prime by dividing x by all the values in 2, . . . , x-1 then checking to see if there is a remainder of 0. The expression a %% b returns the remainder of a divided by b.
```{r}

isprime <- function(x) {
  if (x < 2) return(FALSE)
  if ( x == 2) return(TRUE)
  y = x - 1
  test_num = c(2:y)
  for (n in test_num) {
    if (x %% n == 0) return(FALSE)
  }
  return(TRUE)
}
  
isprime(4)
isprime(37)

##EXTRA CREDIT

prime_num = primes[1:25]
all_num = c(1:100)

for (n in all_num) {
  test = isprime(n)
  if (test == TRUE)
    print(paste(n, 'is a prime number.'))
}
  

```

### 4. Numeric data. Complete problem 2.61 from URIS.
Numeric data can be discretized through the cut function. For example, the command cut(bumpers, c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000)) will categorize the repair cost of a bumper by its rough amount. Make a table of this. Which range has the largest number of data points?

```{r}
# Solution here.
discretized_bumpers = cut(bumpers, c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000))
table(discretized_bumpers)

```
The range ($1000, $2000] has the largest number of data points.

### Extra Credit
```{r}
class(discretized_bumpers)
class(bumpers)
```
The change from data type numeric to factor is because cut() is sorting the bumper costs into the different money ranges(categories/levels) which requires data type 'factor.'

### 5. Cylinders. Complete problem 2.62 from URIS.
The Cylinders variable Cars93 (MASS) data set records the number of cylinders in a factor. What kind of summary does R compute for factors? Look at summary(Cars93$Cylinders) to see.

```{r}

summary(Cars93$Cylinders)
```

summary() for vectors of type 'factor' computes the number of times each level is repeated in the vector (in this case the number of cylinders, if applicable, in 1993 cars). For example, the summary shows that level 3 (cars with 3 cylinders) appears 3 times in the data, level 4 (cars with 4 cylinders) appears 49 times, etc.
