## [Problems]{style="color:#FF7F50"}

We need to first load Verzani's textbook packages `MASS`, `UsingR`, our course package `APMA3150` in our working environment. 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(UsingR)
library(APMA3150)
```

### 1. Drug therapy. Problem 9.3 from URIS. Perform a one-sided test. 
A new drug therapy is tested. Of 50 patients in the study, 40 had no recurrence in their illness after 18 months. With no drug therapy, the expected percentage of no recurrence would have been 75%. 
Does the data support the hypothesis that this percentage has increased? What is the p-value?

#### {.solution}
```{r}

#H0: pdrug = .75
#Ha: pdrug >  .75

prop.test(40, 50, p =.75, alternative = "greater")$p.val

```
p-value = 0.2568146
The data does not support that the percentage of no recurrence has increased as the p-value is larger than the desired significance value of .05.


### 2. Medical insurance. Problem 9.4 from URIS. Perform a two-sided test.
In the United States in 2007, the proportion of adults age 21‚Äì24 who had no medical insurance was 28.1%. A survey of 75 recent college graduates in this age range finds that 40% are without insurance. 
Does this support a difference from the nationwide proportion? Perform a test of significance and report the p-value. Is it significant?

#### {.solution}
```{r}
n = 75
p = .281
phat = 0.40

p_value = pnorm(phat, mean = p, sd = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n), lower.tail = FALSE)
p_value
```
p-value = 0.0109307. Since the p-value is smaller than that of a typical significance level (alpha = 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence that rate of uninsured college students is higher than that of the national population.

### 3. Price of gasoline. Problem 9.9 from URIS.
The United States Department of Energy conducts weekly phone surveys on the price of gasoline sold in the United States. 
Suppose one week the sample average was \$4.03, the sample standard deviation was \$0.42, and the sample size was 800. Perform a one-sided significance test of $H_0 : \mu$ = 4.00 against the alternative $H_A : \mu$ > 4.00.

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...
n = 800
mu = 4.00
xbar = 4.03
s = .42

z_score = (xbar-mu)/(s/sqrt(n))
p.value = pnorm(z_score, lower.tail = FALSE)
p.value
```
p-value = .02167588
The p-value is less than the desired significance value (assumed to be .05) suggesting that the null hypothesis that the price of gas = \$4.00 and is actually greater than \$4.00


### 4. SAT scores. Problem 9.10 from URIS.
The variable sat.m in the data set stud.recs (UsingR) contains math SAT scores for a group of students sampled from a larger population. Test the null hypothesis that the population mean score is 500 against a two-sided alternative. Would you ‚Äúaccept‚Äù or ‚Äúreject‚Äù at a 0.05 significance level?

#### {.solution}
```{r}
mean = 500

t.test(stud.recs$sat.m, mu = mean, alt="two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)$p.value
```
The p-value is smaller than the significance level (0.01099363 < 0.05) therefore we reject the null hypothesis. There is significant evidence that the mean population score differs from 500.


### 5. Cable television service. 
Two different companies have applied to provide cable television service in a certain region. Letùëù denote the proportion of all potential subscribers who favor the first company over the second. Consider testing $H_0$: ùëù = 0.5 versus  $H_a$: ùëù ‚â† 0.5 based on random sample of 25 individuals. Letùëã denote the number in the sample who favor the first company and ùë• represent the observed value of ùëã. No continuity correction needed for this problem.
(i) Of the following rejection regions: $R_1$ = {ùë•: ùë• ‚â§ 7 ùëúùëü ùë• ‚â• 18}, $R_2$ = {ùë•: 8 ‚â§ ùë•}, $R_3$ =
{ùë•: ùë• ‚â§ 17}, which is more appropriate? Why?
(ii) What is the probability distribution of the test statistic ùëã when $H_0$ is true? Use it to
compute the probability of a type-I error using $R_1$ as the rejection region.
(iii) Using rejection region $R_1$, compute the power when ùëù = 0.3, ùëù = 0.4, ùëù = 0.6, ùëù = 0.7.
(iv) Using rejection region $R_1$, what would you conclude if 6 of the 25 queried favored the
first company?

#### {.solution}
```{r}
n = 25

#(i) which rejection region is the most appropriate?
    # Rejection region 1 is most appropriate for the given scenario as it provides limits for a two tailed test which is best if trying to determine that the proportion of customers for each company is NOT .5

#(ii) probability distribution of the test statistic X when H0 is true + probability of type 1 error
    # when H0 is true, the sample population should resemble a binomial distribution

    # type 1 error = proportion of customers for each company are = (.5) but null is rejected (significance/alpha)

alpha.binomial = binom.test(7, n, alternative = "less")$p.value + binom.test(18, n, alternative = "greater")$p.value

cat("Probability of Type 1 error (binomial distribution):", alpha.binomial, "\n")

#(iii) power when p = .3, p = .4, p=.6, p = .7 (power = likelihood of correctly rejecting null)
p = c(.3, .4, .6, .7)
beta =  pbinom(17, n, p = p) - pbinom(7, n, p = p)
power = 1-beta; power


# (iv)
  # x = 6is outside the first rejection region allowing you to reject the null hypothesis and concluded that one company is favored more than the other. 
 
```

(i) Rejection region $R_1$ is most appropriate because it includes both ends of the proportion which is best for a two tailed test when trying to conclude when values are NOT the same (as opposed to less/more than).

(ii) X represents a binomial distribution when $H_0$ is true, as both companies are favored equally by prospective customers. 

(iv) x = 6 is outside $R_1$ allowing you to reject the null hypothesis and concluded that one company is favored the other. 



### 6. Monte Carlo simulation. Estimate the following integral by a Monte Carlo simulation: $\int_{0}^{1} cos( \frac{\pi}{2} x^2)dx$

Hint: If ùëñ is a random number from 0 to 1 based on the uniform distribution,
‚à´ ùëì(x)dx ‚âà $frac{1-0}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)$, where ùëÅ should be large enough.
Your final answer would be the average of multiple evaluations of the above (surely the more
evaluations, the more confident result is)


#### {.solution}
```{r}
func <- function(x) cos((pi / 2) * x^2)
n <- 10000000
x_samp <- runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)
f_values <- func(x_samp)
integral_estimate <- mean(f_values)
integral_estimate
```
final answer = 0.7798478


### 7. Takeoff times. 
We investigate the takeoff times for various airlines at Newark Liberty International Airport. As with other busy airports, Newark's is characterized by long delays on the runway due to requirements that plane departures be staggered. Does this effect all the airlines equally? Without suspecting that any one airline is favored, we can perform a simultaneous pairwise comparison to investigate. First, we massage the data in the package ewr (UsingR) so that we have two variables: one to keep track of the time and the other a factor indicating the airline.

In modeling, the reference level comes from the first level reported by the levels function. This is
AA, or American Airlines.
(i) Make a figure with boxplot for time versus airline.
(ii) From the boxplot, is there any differences observed?
(iii) Are these differences statistically significant? Run an ANOVA test to answer that.
$H_0 : \mu_{AA} = \mu_{CO} = ...= \mu_{US} = \mu $
$H_A : \mu_{AA} ‚â† \mu $ for at least one airline
(iv) For now, we treat the data as a collection of independent samples (rather than the monthly
averages of varying sizes it is) and proceed using the TukeyHSD function. The output of
TukeyHSD is best viewed with the plot of the confidence intervals. This is created by
calling plot on the output. Use the argument las=2, which turns the tick-mark labels
perpendicular to the axes. Find simultaneous CIs by TukeyHSD and plot all CIs. Are
there more than 1 pair differing significantly?

#### {.solution}
```{r}
# Type your solution here...

# Prepare the dataset for Anova
ewr.out <- subset(ewr, subset=inorout=="out", select=3:10)
head(ewr.out)
out <- stack(ewr.out)
names(out) <- c("time","airline")
levels(out$airline)
head(out)

# (i) boxplot with times by airline
boxplot(time~airline, data=out, xlab = "Airline", ylab = "Takeoff time")

# (ii) differences by airline from the boxplot
    # Yes, there do appear to be differences in takeoff times based on airline

# (iii) ANOVA test - Yes, there are differences in take off times across airlines
results <- aov(time~airline, data = out)
summary(results)

# (iv) 
plot(TukeyHSD(results), las=2)

```
(ii) Yes, differences between the takeoff times across airlines are observed comparing box plots

(iii) Yes, the ANOVA results suggest there is at least 1 pair of airlines with non-equal average takeoff times (p-value << .05)

(iv) Yes, there is more than 1 pair of airlines that differ significantly. There are 14 different pairs with significantly different mean takeoff times



### 8. Folacin content of tea. Devore problem 10.27 9th edition.
Please finish this problem step by step rather using high level function aov or TukeyHSD. You can only use aov or TukeyHSD to check your answers.

Although tea is the world‚Äôs most widely consumed beverage
after water, little is known about its nutritional value. Folacin is the only B vitamin present in any significant amount in tea, and recent advances in assay methods have made accurate determination of folacin content feasible. Consider the accompanying data on folacin content for randomly selected specimens of the four leading brands of green tea.

1: 7.9 6.2 6.6 8.6 8.9 10.1 9.6
2: 5.7 7.5 9.8 6.1 8.4
3: 6.8 7.5 5.0 7.4 5.3 6.1
4: 6.4 7.1 7.9 4.5 5.0 4.0

Does this data suggest that true average folacin content is the same for all brands?
a. Carry out a test using $\alpha = 0.05$ via the P-value method.
b. Assess the plausibility of any assumptions required for your analysis in part (a).
c. Perform a multiple comparisons analysis to identify significant differences among brands.

```
a. The p-value of this test is smaller than that of significance level 0.05 (0.02755167 < 0.05) therefore we reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence that there is significant differences in folacin content among brands.

b. QQ plots indicate that normality for each group is plausible. 

c. The pairing of one-four is the only pair that statistically has a significant difference in folacin content among brands since its p-value is smaller than 0.05 and its confidence interval does not include zero. All other pairs are not statistically significant.
